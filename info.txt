it is the result used in DATE paper.
pvt opamp is the second case.
sram access is the first case.
details in yeild_main.m

simulation of pvt opmap is in zqgao/yield/opamp_server_Sep11

Note that it seems that some parameters have been revised under the current path,
and thus the results are different from that shown in TCAD(or DATE) paper.

If you want exactly repeat results, please refer to ../code/

I am sure that you can repeat the results.
