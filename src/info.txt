This is the result/code used in TCAD paper.

For the students coming from my Lab who also want to repeat the simulation results:

1) The simulation of SRAM example used in TCAD paper is implemented via MATLAB. 

2) You can contact me at <zhengqigao@163.com> for more details. 

3) I also cannot guarantee to exactly repeat the 'data_cell.mat' and 'res_cell.mat'.
